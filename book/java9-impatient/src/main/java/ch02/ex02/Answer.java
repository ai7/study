// Consider the nextInt() method of the Scanner class. Is it an accessor or
// mutator? Why? What about the nextInt() method of the Random class?

// Note:
//   Scanner.nextInt() is an accessor, because the state, where we are
//   in the input, should be tracked in the InputStream member
//   variable.
//
//   For Random it is a mutator, since the state/seed is updated which
//   is a member variable.

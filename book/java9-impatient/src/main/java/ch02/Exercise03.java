// Can you ever have a mutator method return something other than
// void? Can you ever have an accessor method returning void? Give
// examples when possible.

// Note:
//   Yes, mutator can return the object itself, such as builders,
//   which changes the state, plus return self, for chaining.
//
//   No, accessor can't return void, how would the value be returned?
